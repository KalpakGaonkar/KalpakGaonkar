## 2. DigSight
- This project was inspired by the new [Google live translation glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj0bFX9HXeE) which were shown off at Google IO 2022
- I was in awe when I first saw these glasses, and that inspired me to think about Augmented Reality (AR) technology and it's applications
- One of the application that instantly came to mind was the use of AR to look at undergraound pipelines for construction workers. This idea popped in my head as our university is building a brand new science building and I had seen workers marking the ground for construction
- This project was completed in a team of 4, where we conducted market research, constructed a canvas business model and finally developed a prototype using Hoverlay

## 3. Taxi booking system
- The taxi booking system is a website, where the user can book taxis to travel throughout the city
- The front-end of this project was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript whereas the back-end was developed using PHP and SQL queries
